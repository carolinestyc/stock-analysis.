# stock-analysis with VBA
### Challenge 2: VBA of Wall Street
## Project Background
My friend Steve asked for assitance analyzing the stock performace history for DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ) and other green energy stocks. I put together a workbook to analyze the data he provided for DQ and the other green energy stocks for 2017 and 2018 but he wants to expand the research. He now wants to include the entire stock market over the last few years. However, my previous code may not work well for all of the stocks he wants to analyze so I have refactored the code to loop through the data only one time. Now, he will be able to analyze more than the 12 stocks originally included in his data set. 


## Findings
Before refactoring the data set the code ran for 0.8984 seconds for the 2017 data and for 0.9065 seconds for the 2018 data. After refactoring the data, the time from start to finished increased substantially across both years. As you can see in the images below, both years now take over 7 seconds to run.
